# Starbix' Vault

My Vault is based on [HEmile](https://www.emilevankrieken.com/blog/2025/academic-obsidian/)'s template and the template from [here](https://gist.github.com/FeralFlora/78f494c1862ce4457cef28d9d9ba5a01).



It differs in the following ways:
- Instead of a flat file structure and relying on the Notebook Navigator fork, I use a nested file structure based on tags and `Auto Note Mover`.
- There are only two colors that are imported from Zotero
  - Red: "Important"
  - Green: "Further Research"
- Custom CSS for hiding Obsidian comments in Papers (`hide-comments.css`)
- Hot Key for importing Notes: `CMD+ü`

## Folder Structure

- **Concepts/**
- **Papers/**
- **People/**
- **Privat/**
- **Projects/**
- **Topics/**
- **Templates/**
- **Assets/** - Assets are stored in the relative subfolder
